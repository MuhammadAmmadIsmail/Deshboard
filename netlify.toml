[build]
  publish = "build"
  command = "bash build.sh"

[build.environment]
  PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11.12"
```

**Additional recommendations:**

1. **Remove the `MISE_PYTHON_COMPILE` line** — it won't help if mise itself can't find the binary
2. **Verify your `runtime.txt`** is in the root directory (same level as `netlify.toml`)
3. **Check if you need a Procfile** for Netlify to properly run your Dash app:
```
   web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:server
